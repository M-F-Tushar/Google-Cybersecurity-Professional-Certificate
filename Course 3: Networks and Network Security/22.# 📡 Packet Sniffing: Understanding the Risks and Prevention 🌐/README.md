# 📡 Packet Sniffing: Understanding the Risks and Prevention 🌐

## Introduction
In this video, we'll discuss packet sniffing, focusing on how threat actors may use this technique to gain unauthorized access to information. Previously, you learned about the information and data packets that travel across the network. 📦

## What is Packet Sniffing? 🤔
Packet sniffing is the practice of using software tools to observe data as it moves across a network. As a security analyst, you may use packet sniffing to analyze and capture packets when investigating ongoing incidents or debugging network issues. However, malicious actors may also use packet sniffing to look at data that has not been sent to them. This is a bit like opening somebody else's mail. 📬

## Malicious Packet Sniffing 🕵️‍♂️
### How It Works
Malicious actors may insert themselves in the middle of an authorized connection between two devices. They can use packet sniffing to spy on every data packet as it comes across their device, finding valuable information to use to their advantage. Attackers can use software applications or hardware devices to look into data packets and make changes to the data, like altering a recipient's bank account number. 💻🔍

### Types of Packet Sniffing Attacks 🚨
- **Passive Packet Sniffing**: Data packets are read in transit. This is like a postal delivery person maliciously reading somebody's mail. 📨
- **Active Packet Sniffing**: Data packets are manipulated in transit. This is like a neighbor telling the delivery person, "I'll deliver that mail for you," then reading or changing the letter before putting it in your mailbox. 📬✏️

## Preventing Malicious Packet Sniffing 🛡️
### 1. Use a VPN 🔒
A VPN encrypts and protects data as it travels across the network, preventing hackers from decoding it to read your private information. 🌐

### 2. Use HTTPS 🛡️
Make sure websites you use have HTTPS at the beginning of the domain address. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data and prevent eavesdropping. 🔐

### 3. Avoid Unprotected WiFi 🚫
Avoid using unprotected WiFi in public places like coffee shops, restaurants, or airports. These networks don't use encryption, making it easy for anyone on the network to access all the data traveling to and from your device. 🛑

## Conclusion 🌟
Now you know how threat actors may use packet sniffing and how to protect a network from these attacks. Let's move on to discuss other network intrusions. 🚀
