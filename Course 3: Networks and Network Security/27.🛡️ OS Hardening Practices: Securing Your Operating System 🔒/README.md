# 🛡️ OS Hardening Practices: Securing Your Operating System 🔒

## Introduction
In this video, we'll discuss operating system (OS) hardening and why it's essential to keep the entire network secure. The OS is the interface between computer hardware and the user, acting as an intermediary between software applications and the computer hardware. It's crucial to secure the OS in each system because one insecure OS can lead to the whole network being compromised. 🌐

## OS Hardening Tasks 🛠️

### Regular Interval Tasks ⏲️
1. **Patch Installation (Patch Updates)** 🔄
   - **Definition**: Software and OS updates that address security vulnerabilities within a program or product.
   - **Importance**: Running patch updates as soon as they are released is critical to fix security vulnerabilities. 🛡️
   - **Example**: My team had to perform an emergency patch to address a recent vulnerability found in a commonly used programming library. The newly updated OS should be added to the baseline configuration.

2. **Hardware and Software Disposal** 🗑️
   - **Definition**: Ensuring all old hardware is properly wiped and disposed of, and deleting any unused software applications to eliminate unnecessary vulnerabilities. 🔒

3. **Strong Password Policy** 📝
   - **Definition**: Enforcing password policies that require strong passwords, typically a minimum of eight characters, including a capital letter, a number, and a symbol.
   - **Additional Security**: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires users to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network. 🔐

### One-Time Preliminary Safety Measures 🚀
1. **Secure Encryption Standard Configuration** 🔧
   - **Definition**: Configuring device settings to fit a secure encryption standard. 📊

## OS Hardening Techniques 🔍
1. **Patch Updates** 🔄
   - Run patch updates as soon as they are released. 🔔

2. **Baseline Configuration** 🛠️
   - **Definition**: A documented set of specifications within a system that serves as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.
   - **Usage**: Compare the current configuration to the baseline to identify any changes. 📋

3. **Deleting Unused Software** 🗑️
   - **Importance**: Removing unused software reduces unnecessary vulnerabilities. 🔒

4. **Strong Password Policies and MFA** 🔐
   - Enforce password policies and implement Multi-Factor Authentication to increase security. 🛡️

## Conclusion
OS hardening is a set of procedures that maintains and improves OS security. Regularly checking security measures like access privileges and password policies is essential. Stay tuned for the next video on network hardening practices! 🚀
