# 👨‍💻 Matt's Journey and Dealing with Cyber Attacks 🛡️

## Introduction
My name's Matt, and I'm a chaos specialist at Google. They let us choose our own job titles to best describe what it is we do. I spend a lot of my time planning for how to take care of anything that might possibly go wrong, and when it does happen, putting a team in place to fix it as quickly as possible. 🚑💻

## Career Background 🛠️
I had no intention of being in technology at all. In high school, I was a lifeguard, first at public pools and then at a state beach. Lifeguarding got me into really enjoying rescue. So I got an EMT license and went through firefighter school. About halfway through my college process, and well into when I was being a firefighter on a daily basis, I was dealing with some burnout and stress. I needed a change in my life. 🌊🧯

## Transition to Technology 🚀
A friend of mine, who I'd been online gaming with since the early days of online gaming when it was all text-based, said, "I can tell you're burning out hard and you need a change. My friends and I are going to San Francisco to start a startup. Will you come with us?" And I said, "You realize I am not a computer guy, right?" He replied, "No, you're a computer guy, you just won't admit it." 🎮💡

## Love for Incident Response 🛡️
The same thing that has drawn me into incident response in tech is what originally drew me to medical response. I really love being there for people on their worst day. Being there when people really need you, and they don't know where else to turn to, has always just fed this part of me, and I'm lucky to find that same joy in DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response). 🚑💻

## Types of Attacks Faced at Google 🎯
What type of attacks have we faced at Google? That's a hard question to answer, because we face all of the kinds of attacks that most other companies face. People after ransomware, people after industrial secrets, other countries looking for intelligence information. 📊🔓

## Interesting Attack Example 🕵️‍♂️
There was a really interesting attack that occurred a little while ago. They were interested in getting a lot of information from technical companies, specifically about vulnerabilities in software. They put in place a long-running campaign to build personalities on social media as though they were legitimate security researchers, and then reached out to other security researchers in our field, built relationships, and then just at the right moment, snuck in some malware. 🔐

## Handling an Attack 🚨
Being under attack by an adversary who's made some progress is incredibly stressful. The first things you're thinking and feeling are a little bit of a sense of panic. "Oh no, this is going to be a bad day. How long am I going to be awake working on this? What have they done? What am I going to do?" And for me, the mantra that I repeat to myself is, "As an incident responder, I am here to help." 🤯🛡️

## The 3Cs: Command, Control, and Communications 📞
The things that are most important to having a good outcome in an incident are what we call the 3Cs: Command, Control, and Communications. 
- **Command**: Someone needs to be in charge of it, affirmatively leading.
- **Control**: Someone needs to be exerting control over everyone involved so that everyone's aligned and focused on the mission.
- **Communications**: Proper communications are the biggest and most important aspect. If you have something to offer to the incident, don't just go do it; communicate to someone. 🚦

## Advice for Aspiring Cybersecurity Professionals 💡
The advice that I would give somebody who wants to get into cybersecurity is if you want it, you probably belong here. The more people we have in here who are passionate, curious question askers, who want to know more, who want to build better, and who care about making everything more secure for the people who have to use technology—those are the people we want in the industry, and I would want you here. 🌟🔐
