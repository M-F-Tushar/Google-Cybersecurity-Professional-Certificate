# 📡 Common Devices That Make Up a Network 🌐

## Introduction
In this video, you'll learn about the common devices that make up a network. Let's get started! 🚀

## Network Devices 🔌

### 🌟 Hub
A hub is a network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network. Think of a hub like a radio tower that broadcasts a signal to any radio tuned to the correct frequency. 📡

### 🌟 Switch
A switch is more intelligent than a hub. It makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them. It only passes data to the intended destination, making switches more secure and enabling them to control the flow of traffic and improve network performance. 🔒

### 🌟 Router
A router is a network device that connects multiple networks together. For example, if a computer in one network wants to send information to a tablet on another network, the information will be transferred as follows:
1. The information travels from the computer to the router. 💻
2. The router reads the destination address and forwards the data to the intended network's router. 🌍
3. The receiving router directs that information to the tablet. 📱

### 🌟 Modem
A modem is a device that connects your router to the internet, bringing internet access to the LAN. For example, if a computer from one network wants to send information to a device on a network in a different geographic location, it would be transferred as follows:
1. The computer sends information to the router. 💻
2. The router transfers the information through the modem to the internet. 🌐
3. The intended recipient's modem receives the information and transfers it to the router. 📶
4. Finally, the recipient's router forwards that information to the destination device. 📲

## Virtualization Tools 🌩️
Network tools such as hubs, switches, routers, and modems are physical devices. However, many functions performed by these physical devices can be completed by virtualization tools. Virtualization tools are pieces of software that perform network operations and are offered by Cloud service providers. These tools provide opportunities for cost savings and scalability. 💾

## Conclusion
Now you've explored some common devices that make up a network. Coming up, you're going to learn more about cloud computing and how networks can be designed using cloud services. ☁️

Stay tuned! 🌟
