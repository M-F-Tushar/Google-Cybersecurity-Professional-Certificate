# 🌐 Network Protocols: Understanding the Rules of Communication 📡

## Introduction
Networks benefit from having rules. Rules ensure that data sent over the network gets to the right place. These rules are known as network protocols. Network protocols are a set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of the data. 📦

## Scenario: Accessing a Website 🌍
Let's use a scenario to demonstrate a few different types of network protocols and how they work together on a network. Say you want to access your favorite recipe website. You go to the address bar at the top of your browser and type in the website's address. For example: www.yummyrecipesforme.org. 🍲

### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) 🤝
- **Function**: An internet communications protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.
- **Example**: Establishing communication with a web server before accessing the website. This process is often referred to as a handshake. 🤝

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) 🗂️
- **Function**: Determines the MAC address of the next router or device on the path, ensuring that data gets to the right place.
- **Example**: Ensuring the data packets move between network devices such as routers. 📦

### HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) 🔒
- **Function**: Provides a secure method of communication between client and website servers.
- **Example**: Your web browser securely sends a request for a webpage to the Yummy Recipes For Me server and receives a webpage as a response. 🔐

### DNS (Domain Name System) 🌐
- **Function**: Translates internet domain names into IP addresses.
- **Example**: The DNS protocol sends the domain name and web address to a DNS server that retrieves the IP address of the website you were trying to access. 🌍

## Summary of Protocols Used 📋
Just by visiting one website, the devices on your network are using four different protocols: TCP, ARP, HTTPS, and DNS. These protocols are essential for network communications. 🌟

## Security Aspect 🛡️
### HTTPS and SSL/TLS 🔐
- **Function**: Encrypts data using the Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS).
- **Purpose**: Helps keep information secure from malicious actors who want to steal valuable information. 🛡️

## Conclusion
That's a lot of information and a lot of protocols to remember! Throughout your career as a security analyst, you'll become more familiar with network protocols and use them in your daily activities. Keep learning and stay curious! 🚀
