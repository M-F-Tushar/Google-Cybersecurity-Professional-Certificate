# 🚀 Welcome to Module 2!

## Introduction
Congratulations on the progress you've made so far! In this section, you'll learn about how networks operate using tools and protocols. These are concepts that you'll use every day in your work as a security analyst. 💡

## Importance of Tools and Protocols
The tools and protocols you'll learn in this section of the program will help you protect your organization's network from attacks. Did you know that malicious actors can take advantage of data moving from one device to another on a network? 😨 Thankfully, there are tools and protocols to ensure the network stays protected against this type of threat. 🛡️

### Real-World Example 🕵️‍♂️
As an example, I once identified an attack based solely on the fact they were using the wrong protocol. The network traffic volumes were right, and it was coming from a trusted IP, but it was on the wrong protocol, which tipped us off enough to shut down the attack before they caused real damage. 🛑

## Topics Covered
1. **Common Network Protocols** 🌐
2. **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** 🛡️
3. **Firewalls** 🔥
4. **Security Zones** 🏰
5. **Proxy Servers** 🌍

## Conclusion
Now that you have an idea of where we're headed, let's get started! 🚀
