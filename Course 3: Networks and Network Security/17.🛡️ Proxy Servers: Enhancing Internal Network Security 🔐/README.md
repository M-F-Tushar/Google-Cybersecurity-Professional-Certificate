# 🛡️ Proxy Servers: Enhancing Internal Network Security 🔐

## Introduction
Previously, we discussed how firewalls, VPNs, and security zones help secure networks. Now, let's cover how to secure internal networks with proxy servers. Proxy servers are another essential system that helps secure networks. 🌐

## What is a Proxy Server? 🤔
A proxy server is a dedicated server that sits between the internet and the rest of the network. It fulfills the request of a client by forwarding them to other servers. Here's how it works:
- **Incoming Requests**: When a request to connect to the network comes in from the internet, the proxy server determines if the connection request is safe. 🛡️
- **Public IP Address**: The proxy server uses a public IP address that is different from the rest of the private network, hiding the private network's IP address from malicious actors on the internet. 🌍
- **Example**: When a client receives an HTTPS response, they notice a distorted or no IP address rather than the real IP address of the organization's web server. 🔐

## Benefits of Proxy Servers 🌟
Proxy servers provide several security benefits:
- **Blocking Unsafe Websites**: A proxy server can block unsafe websites that users aren't allowed to access on an organization's network. 🚫
- **Temporary Memory Storage**: Proxy servers use temporary memory to store data that's regularly requested by external servers, reducing contact with the internal server and enhancing security. 💾

## Types of Proxy Servers 🔍

### Forward Proxy Server ➡️
- **Function**: Regulates and restricts a person's access to the internet by hiding a user's IP address and approving all outgoing requests. 🌐
- **Example**: In an organization, a forward proxy server receives outgoing traffic from an employee, approves it, and then forwards it to the destination on the internet. 🖥️

### Reverse Proxy Server ⬅️
- **Function**: Regulates and restricts internet access to an internal server by accepting traffic from external parties, approving it, and forwarding it to the internal servers. 🔄
- **Example**: Useful for protecting internal web servers containing confidential data from exposing their IP address to external parties. 🔒

### Email Proxy Server 📧
- **Function**: Filters spam email by verifying whether a sender's address was forged, reducing the risk of phishing attacks that impersonate people known to the organization. ✉️
- **Real-World Example**: In a large U.S. broadband ISP, a proxy server implemented multiple layers of anti-spam filtering before a message was allowed for delivery, tagging around 95% of messages as spam. 🛡️

## Conclusion 🌟
Proxy servers play an essential role in network security by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic and staying alert to network attacks. These devices add a layer of protection from the unsecured public network called the internet. 🌐
