# ☁️ Cloud Security Explained by Kelsey 🌟

## Introduction
Hi! I'm Kelsey, a distinguished engineer at Google Cloud. I work on compute platforms and security-related topics. In this note, I'll share some insights about cloud security and my journey into the tech world. 🚀

## My Career Journey 🛤️
When I was starting, the only jobs I had previous, the only jobs I was confident were accessible to me were fast food jobs. I wanted a career, I wanted more than just a job. So when I zoomed out and asked myself, what were my career options? I couldn't think of a better place in the year 1999 than going into the world of technologies. I mean, on the news people were lining up for the latest operating system. All the tech people were the new rock stars. 🎸

I remember flipping through the job openings in the classified section, and it said anyone that has one of these certifications let us know because we're hiring. The delta between getting started and getting your first job into that career that I always wanted, it was $35 away in a certification book. 📘

## Understanding Cloud 🌐
Before the time of Cloud, most companies had their own data center. Imagine it's just you alone in your house; you can put anything wherever you want. You may choose to never lock the doors on the inside; it's just you. And for a long time in our industry, that's the way people ran their data centers. Now, we just call that private Cloud. But Cloud is public.

### Cloud vs. Private Cloud 🏢
The analogy would be, imagine getting roommates. Now you start to think differently about your stuff. You start to lock things up even while you're inside of the house, and your security discipline is going to be very different. As more and more companies move into Cloud, you may just be the person who can help one of those organizations finally make that leap because they have a professional on their team. 🔐

## Gaining Practical Skills 🛠️
So you've gotten the certification, you've gotten the fundamental skills, how do you make sure that you can actually use them in the Cloud? I'm going to let you in on a little secret: Go use the Cloud. Take existing software, throw it in the Cloud, and find all the tools that poke and prod at the thing you just got running. It's going to tell you where you're weak. Learn those tools because those are the tools that the professionals use. 💡

## The Power of Learning 🌟
Learning is a superpower. It gives you the ability to not only get that job that you've been looking at, but it also gives you the ability to define the next one. 🚀
