# 🌐 Cloud Networks: Modernizing Network Management ☁️

## Introduction
Companies have traditionally owned their network devices and kept them in their own office buildings. But now, many companies are using third-party providers to manage their networks. Why? This model helps companies save money while giving them access to more network resources. 📉💼

## The Rise of Cloud Computing 📈
The growth of cloud computing is helping many companies reduce costs and streamline their network operations. Cloud computing is the practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services hosted on the internet instead of local physical devices. 🌍💾

## Benefits of Cloud Networks 💡
Today, the number of businesses that use cloud computing is increasing every year, so it's important to understand how cloud networks function and how to secure them. Cloud providers offer an alternative to traditional on-premise networks, allowing organizations to have the benefits of the traditional network without storing the devices and managing the network on their own. 🏢➡️☁️

## What is a Cloud Network? 🤔
A cloud network is a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet. Because companies don't house the servers at their physical location, these servers are referred to as being "in the cloud". 🌩️

## Traditional vs. Cloud Networks 🏠📡
Traditional networks host web servers from a business in its physical location. However, cloud networks use remote servers, allowing online services and web applications to be used from any geographic location. 🌎

## The Growing Importance of Cloud Security 🔐
Cloud security will become increasingly relevant to many security professionals as more organizations migrate to cloud services. Cloud service providers offer cloud computing to maintain applications. For example, they provide on-demand storage and processing power that their customers only pay as needed. 💰

## Additional Services Provided by Cloud Providers 📊
They also provide business and web analytics that organizations can use to monitor their web traffic and sales. With the transition to cloud networking, there is an overlap of identity-based security on top of the more traditional network-based solutions. This means focusing on verifying both where the traffic is coming from and the identity that is coming with it. 📈🔍

## Conclusion 🚀
More organizations are moving their network services to the cloud to save money and simplify their operations. As this trend grows, cloud security becomes a significant aspect of network security. 🛡️
