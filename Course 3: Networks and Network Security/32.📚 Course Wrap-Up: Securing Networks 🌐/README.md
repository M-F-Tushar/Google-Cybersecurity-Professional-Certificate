# 📚 Course Wrap-Up: Securing Networks 🌐

Wow, we have covered a lot in this course! Let's review everything we've discussed:

## Network Structure 🏗️
You learned about networks and network architecture, gaining an understanding of how networks are designed. This knowledge helps identify parts of a network that present vulnerabilities and need to be secured.

## Network Operations and Communication 🛠️
We explored network operations and how they affect data communication. Network protocols determine how data is transmitted over the network.

## Security Threats and Protection 🛡️
We discussed various tactics used by malicious actors, such as:
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks** 🚫
- **Packet Sniffing** 📡
- **IP Spoofing** 🕵️

Security analysts employ tools and measures like firewall rules to protect against these attacks.

## Security Hardening 🛠️
Security hardening is used to reduce the attack surface of a network. It can be done at the hardware level, software level, or network level. This ensures that an attack does not disable an entire network.

## Career Preparation 🚀
Securing networks is an essential part of a security analyst's duties. Knowledge of network operations and security practices will ensure success in your career as a security analyst.

## What's Next? 🎓
And that brings us to the topic of our next course, which will cover computing basics for security analysts. In that course, you'll learn how to use the Linux command line to authenticate and authorize users on the network, and to use SQL to communicate with databases.

Great work getting here! All of the concepts you've learned in this section will be essential for success in your role as a security analyst. Now you can move on to the next course. Enjoy!
