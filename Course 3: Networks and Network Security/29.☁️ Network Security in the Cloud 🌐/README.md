# ☁️ Network Security in the Cloud 🌐

## Introduction
In recent years, many organizations are using network services in the cloud. So, in addition to securing on-premises networks, a security analyst will need to secure cloud networks. Just like regular web servers, cloud servers also require proper maintenance done through various security hardening procedures. 🛡️

## What is a Cloud Network? 🤔
A cloud network is a collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet. They can host company data and applications using cloud computing to provide on-demand storage, processing power, and data analytics. 🌍

## Cloud Network Hardening 🛠️
### Server Baseline Image 📋
One distinction between cloud network hardening and traditional network hardening is the use of a server baseline image for all server instances stored in the cloud. This allows you to compare data in the cloud servers to the baseline image to make sure there haven't been any unverified changes. An unverified change could come from an intrusion in the cloud network. 🔍

### Data and Application Separation 📂
Similar to OS hardening, data and applications on a cloud network are kept separate depending on their service category. For example, older applications should be kept separate from newer applications, and software that deals with internal functions should be kept separate from front-end applications seen by users. 🔒

## Shared Responsibility 🤝
Even though the cloud service provider has a shared responsibility with the organization using their services, there are still security measures that need to be taken by the organization to make sure their cloud network is safe. Just like traditional networks, operations in the cloud need to be secured. 🛡️

## Conclusion 🌟
You're doing great! Keep up the fantastic work and stay tuned for the next video! 🚀
