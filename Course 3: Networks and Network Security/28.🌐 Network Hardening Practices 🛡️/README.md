# 🌐 Network Hardening Practices 🛡️

## Introduction
Earlier, you learned that OS hardening focuses on device safety and uses patch updates, secure configuration, and account access policies. Now we'll focus on network hardening. Network hardening focuses on network-related security hardening, like port filtering, network access privileges, and encryption over networks. Certain network hardening tasks are performed regularly, while others are performed once and then updated as needed. 🛠️

## Regularly Performed Tasks 🔄
### Firewall Rules Maintenance 🔥
Regularly maintaining firewall rules to ensure they are up-to-date and effective. 🛡️

### Network Log Analysis 📊
Examining network logs to identify events of interest using a log analyzer tool or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool. SIEM tools collect and analyze log data to monitor critical activities in an organization and present data on a single dashboard, often called a single pane of glass. 📋

### Patch Updates and Server Backups 🔄
Performing regular patch updates and server backups to fix vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity. 🔐

## Tasks Performed Once 🛠️
### Port Filtering on Firewalls 🌐
Port filtering is a firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication. Only necessary ports should be allowed, and any port not used by normal network operations should be disallowed to protect against port vulnerabilities. 🚪

### Network Access Privileges 🗝️
Setting up network access privileges to control who can access different segments of a network. This includes using network segmentation to create isolated subnets for different departments within an organization, ensuring issues in one subnet don't spread across the entire company. 🏢

### Encryption for Communication 🔒
Ensuring all network communication is encrypted using the latest encryption standards. Data in restricted zones should have higher encryption standards to make them more difficult to access. 🔏

## Network Segmentation 🌍
Security analysts also use network segmentation to create isolated subnets for different departments, such as one for the marketing department and another for the finance department. This is done so that issues in each subnet don't spread across the whole company, and only specified users are given access to the part of the network they require for their role. Network segmentation may also be used to separate different security zones, especially for restricted zones containing highly classified or confidential data. 🚦

## Conclusion 🌟
You've learned about the most common hardening practices, including regularly performed tasks like firewall rules maintenance and network log analysis, as well as one-time tasks like port filtering and setting network access privileges. This knowledge will be useful as you complete the certificate program and is essential to your career as a security analyst. 🚀
