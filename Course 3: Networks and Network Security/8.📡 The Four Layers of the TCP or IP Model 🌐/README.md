# 📡 The Four Layers of the TCP/IP Model 🌐

## Introduction
Now that we've discussed the structure of a network and how communications take place, it's important for you to know how security professionals identify problems that might arise. The TCP/IP model is a framework that is used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted across the network. The TCP/IP model has four layers. Knowing how the TCP/IP model organizes network activity allows security professionals to monitor and secure against risks. Let's examine these layers one at a time. 🚀

## Layer 1: Network Access Layer 🛠️
The network access layer deals with the creation of data packets and their transmission across a network. This includes hardware devices connected to physical cables and switches that direct data to its destination. 🌐

## Layer 2: Internet Layer 🌍
The internet layer is where IP addresses are attached to data packets to indicate the location of the sender and receiver. This layer focuses on how networks connect to each other. For example, data packets contain information that determines whether they will stay on the LAN or be sent to a remote network, like the internet. 📦

## Layer 3: Transport Layer 🚚
The transport layer includes protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network. These protocols permit or deny communication with other devices and include information about the status of the connection. Activities of this layer include error control, ensuring data flows smoothly across the network. 📡

## Layer 4: Application Layer 📧
At the application layer, protocols determine how the data packets will interact with receiving devices. Functions organized at the application layer include file transfers and email services. 📂

## Conclusion
Now you have an understanding of the TCP/IP model and its four layers. Stay tuned for more videos to continue your journey in network security! 🎬
