# 🔒 Security Hardening: Strengthening Your Network 🛡️

## Introduction
Security analysts and the organizations they work with have to be proactive about protecting systems from attack. This is where security hardening comes in. Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface. All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit are referred to as a system's attack surface. Let's use an example that compares a network to a house. The attack surface would be all the doors and windows that a robber could use to gain access to that house. 🏠

## Minimizing the Attack Surface 🛡️
Just like putting locks on all the doors and windows in the house, security hardening involves minimizing the attack surface or potential vulnerabilities and keeping a network as secure as possible. As part of security hardening, security analysts perform regular maintenance procedures to keep network devices and systems functioning securely and optimally. 🔐

## Types of Security Hardening 📊
Security hardening can be conducted on any device or system that can be compromised, such as:
- **Hardware**
- **Operating Systems**
- **Applications**
- **Computer Networks**
- **Databases**

### Physical Security 🏢
Physical security is also a part of security hardening. This may include securing a physical space with security cameras and security guards. Some common types of hardening procedures include software updates, also called patches, and device application configuration changes. These updates and changes are done to increase security and fix security vulnerabilities on a network. 🔒

### Examples of Security Hardening 🛠️
- **Configuration Changes**: Requiring longer passwords or more frequent password changes to make it harder for a malicious actor to gain login credentials.
- **Encryption Standards**: Updating the encryption standards for data stored in a database to make it harder for malicious actors to access the database.
- **Disabling Unused Features**: Removing or disabling unused applications and services, disabling unused ports, and reducing access permissions across devices and networks. This makes network and device monitoring more efficient and reduces the overall attack surface. 📉

## Penetration Testing 💼
Another important strategy for security hardening is to conduct regular penetration testing. A penetration test, also called a pen test, is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in a system, network, website, application, and process. Penetration testers document their findings in a report. Depending on where the test fails, security teams can determine the type of security vulnerabilities that require fixing. Organizations can then review these vulnerabilities and come up with a plan to fix them. 🛡️

## Conclusion 🌟
Security hardening is an essential aspect of securing networks. It's a foundational part of network security that strengthens the network to reduce the number of successful attacks. Keep up the great work, Mahir, and stay tuned for more insights on network security! 🚀
