# 🌐 IP Addresses and Network Communication 📡

## Introduction
Let's learn about how IP addresses are used to communicate over a network. IP stands for Internet Protocol. An Internet Protocol address, or IP address, is a unique string of characters that identifies the location of a device on the internet. Just like every house on a street has its own mailing address, each device on the internet has a unique IP address. 🏠

## Types of IP Addresses 📑
### IPv4 Address 🌐
- **Structure**: Written as four sets of 1, 2, or 3-digit numbers separated by decimal points. Example: 192.168.1.1
- **History**: In the early days of the internet, all IP addresses were IPv4. 🌍

### IPv6 Address 🌐
- **Structure**: Made up of 32 characters.
- **Purpose**: Developed because the growing use of the internet meant that all IPv4 addresses were getting used up. IPv6 allows for more devices to be connected without running out of addresses quickly. 🆕

## Public vs. Private IP Addresses 🌏
### Public IP Address 🏙️
- **Function**: Assigned by your internet service provider (ISP) and connected to your geographic location. 🌍
- **Analogy**: Just like all roommates in one home share the same mailing address, all devices on a network share the same public-facing IP address. 🏠

### Private IP Address 🏡
- **Function**: Seen only by other devices on the same local network. This allows devices on your home network to communicate using unique IP addresses that the rest of the internet can't see. 🔒

## MAC Address 🔢
### Definition
- A MAC address is a unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each physical device on a network. 📠

### Function
- **Switch Handling**: When a switch receives a data packet, it reads the MAC address of the destination device and maps it to a port. It then stores this information in a MAC address table, which functions like an address book to direct data packets to the correct device. 📖

## Conclusion
In this video, you learned about IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, how IP and MAC addresses are used in network communication, and the difference between public and private IP addresses. 📘
