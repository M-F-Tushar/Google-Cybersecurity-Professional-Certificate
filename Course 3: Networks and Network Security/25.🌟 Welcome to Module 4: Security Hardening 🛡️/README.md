# 🌟 Welcome to Module 4: Security Hardening 🛡️

## Congratulations! 🎉
I want to take a moment to congratulate you on your progress so far. First, you learned about network operations. Then, you learned about the tools and protocols that help network systems function. Next, you learned how vulnerabilities in networks expose them to various security intrusions. 📚

## What's Next? 🚀
Now, we'll discuss security hardening. We'll learn about:
- **OS Hardening** 🖥️
- **Network Hardening Practices** 🌐
- **Cloud Hardening Practices** ☁️

Security hardening can be implemented in devices, networks, applications, and cloud infrastructure. Security analysts may perform tasks such as patch updates and backups as part of security hardening. 🛠️

## Importance of Hardening 🌟
As a security analyst, hardening will play a major role in your day-to-day tasks. It's important for you to understand how it works. I'm excited to accompany you on this journey. 🎓

## Stay Tuned! 🎬
Meet you in the next video!
