# 🛡️ Ellen's Journey into Cybersecurity 🚀

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Ellen, a Security Engineering Manager at Google, specializing in how Google uses the cloud. Cybersecurity wasn't even a field when I got started in technology, and it's something I came to later. Let me share my unique path into this exciting field. 🌟

## Beginnings in Technology 🛠️
My journey began while I was working retail at a poster store. We needed to build a website, and my feet hurt from standing all day. I really needed to sit down, so I asked friends to teach me HTML so I could work while giving my blisters a rest. 🖥️

## Landing an Internship 📈
One of our customers, who worked at a startup, often got employee photos framed and asked for feedback on my website. They ended up offering me an internship! This opportunity opened doors for me to specialize in API design, where I designed interfaces for developers to communicate with machines. 🛠️

## Transition to Security 🔐
Through my work in API design, I landed a job designing a miniature version of an operating system for security technology. This was my introduction to the world of security. 🎯

## Diverse Backgrounds 🌍
Most of the people I know in cybersecurity, especially in the early days, don't have a degree at all. Or if they do, it's in something like philosophy or poetry, just like me. Almost everyone learned on their own by experimenting, talking to people, and reading. 🌱

## No Technical Background Required 🚫
I would say no technical background is required. In fact, having a background where you're used to being out in the real world can sometimes make cybersecurity make more sense and help you make more balanced choices. 🧠

## Building a Security Community 🤝
In almost all areas, there's a security community you can find. Look for local conferences, start talking to people. It's a lot more fun to learn that way than in a vacuum. Most people, if you ask for help and offer to buy them a coffee, are usually willing to share their knowledge. ☕️

## Advice for Non-Technical Folks 🌟
Don't be afraid of the technology. It might seem like only someone with a computer science degree could understand it, but these concepts and technologies are understandable by anyone. Pick an area that interests you and dive in. Stay curious and find what interests you, and you'll learn the technology. 🚀
