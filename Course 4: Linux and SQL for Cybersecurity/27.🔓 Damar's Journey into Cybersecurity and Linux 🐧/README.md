# 🔓 Damar's Journey into Cybersecurity and Linux 🐧

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Damar, a security engineer at Google. Since I was a kid, I've always been fascinated by cybersecurity. I loved watching cartoons where characters used floppy disks or flash drives to cause havoc. 😄 This sparked my interest in cybersecurity.

## Career Path 🛤️
Before joining Google, I had various jobs, including making smoothies at Jamba Juice and working at Geek Squad. Eventually, I became a security engineer at Google. My advice for those trying to get into cybersecurity: it might be easier than you think! 😊

## Learning Linux 🐧
Linux is an essential skill because it's widely used across many companies. You may use Linux to curate logs or set up bash jobs for routine tasks. I first became interested in Linux after watching the Jurassic Park movie, where characters used a UNIX operating system. This inspired me to learn more about Linux.

## Advice for Learning Linux 💡
Don't get discouraged by small hiccups. Think of it like learning to swim—you might not be great at it initially, but with persistence, you'll get better. 🏊‍♂️ There are plenty of support resources for learning Linux, including discussion forums in the certificate course, Stack Overflow, and Reddit posts.

## Working in Cybersecurity 🛡️
I love working in cybersecurity. It's satisfying to know that my team and I are helping protect people online from threats they might not even be aware of. 🌐
