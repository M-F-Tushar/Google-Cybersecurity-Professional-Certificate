# 🏗️ Understanding Linux Architecture 🌐

## Introduction
Let's start with a quick question that may seem unrelated to security. Do you have a favorite building? What is it about its architecture that impresses you the most? The windows? The structure of the walls? Just like buildings, operating systems also have an architecture and are made up of discrete components that work together to form the whole. In this note, we'll explore all the components that together make up Linux. 🏢

## Components of Linux 🐧
The components of Linux include the user, applications, the shell, the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, the kernel, and the hardware. Don't worry—we'll dive into these components one by one together. 😊

### The User 👤
First, you are the user. The user is the person interacting with the computer. In Linux, you're the first element of the architecture of the operating system. You're initiating the tasks or commands that the OS is going to execute. Linux is a multi-user system, meaning more than one user can use the system's resources at the same time.

### Applications 📱
The second element of the architecture is the applications within a system. An application is a program that performs a specific task, such as a word processor or a calculator. You might hear the words "applications" and "programs" used interchangeably. One popular Linux application that we'll learn more about later is Nano. Nano is a text editor that helps you keep notes on the screen. Linux applications are commonly distributed through package managers. 📦

### The Shell 🐚
The next component in the architecture of Linux is the shell. This is an important element because it is how you will communicate with the system. The shell is a command line interpreter that processes commands and outputs the results. You can think of the shell as a CLI (command-line interface).

### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) 📂
Another element of the architecture of Linux is the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, or FHS. It's the component of the Linux OS that organizes data. Think of the FHS as a filing cabinet of data. The FHS is how data is stored in a system, organizing data so it can be found when accessed by the system.

### The Kernel 🧠
That brings us to the kernel. The kernel is a component of the Linux OS that manages processes and memory. The kernel communicates with the hardware to execute the commands sent by the shell. It uses drivers to enable applications to execute tasks. The Linux kernel helps ensure that the system allocates resources efficiently and makes the system work faster.

### Hardware 💾
Finally, the last component of the architecture is the hardware. Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, mouse, and keyboard. Think of hardware as the tangible parts of the system, compared to software applications that can be downloaded.

## Conclusion 🌟
Congratulations! We've now covered the architecture of Linux. An understanding of these components will help you become increasingly familiar with Linux. Keep up the great work! 🚀
