# 🌟 Kim's Journey into Computing 🚀

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Kim. I'm a technical program manager at Google. I currently work in the security, mergers, and acquisitions team, helping newly acquired companies integrate into the Google environment. I've held multiple roles before getting into cybersecurity and technology. 🛠️

## Career Path 🛤️
I first started working as a restaurant worker and then became an English Tutor for international students at my local college. After multiple internships and graduating from university, I had my first opportunity to work in technology. That's where my interest in technology and eventually cybersecurity began. 🌐

## Encouragement for Everyone 🌟
I want to tell everyone with any type of background that you can get into cybersecurity. If you're interested in protecting information and people in the future, security is there for you. There are many different roles you can do, and all of the skills you have now and have gathered previously can be applicable within security. 🛡️

## The Importance of Connection 🔗
The skill I use the most is connecting with people every day. I can't get anything done unless I connect with them the right way. So that's actually the biggest skill I lean on the most working in security. 🗣️

## Advice for Aspiring Cybersecurity Professionals 💡
Keep an open mind. I started with a degree in business and didn't even feel like I was technical enough to be where I am today. Before that, all my experiences were either restaurant work, marketing work, or something unrelated to technology. But all of that helped and motivated me to get more into technology and eventually security. Before I knew it, self-doubt was replaced with support from my peers and respect from people I've worked with. 🚀
