## Introduction
In this section, we're going to cover a Linux distribution that's widely used in security and discuss KALI LINUX™. KALI LINUX™ is a trademark of Offensive Security and is Debian derived. This open-source distro was made specifically with penetration testing and digital forensics in mind. 🌐

## Penetration Testing Tools 🛠️
There are many tools pre-installed into KALI LINUX™. It's important to note that KALI LINUX™ should be used on a virtual machine. This prevents damage to your system in the event its tools are used improperly. An additional benefit is that using a virtual machine gives you the ability to revert to a previous state. Here are a few tools commonly used during penetration testing:
- **Metasploit**: Used to look for and exploit vulnerabilities on machines.
- **Burp Suite**: Helps test for weaknesses in web applications.
- **John the Ripper**: A tool used to guess passwords. 🔐

## Digital Forensics Tools 🔍
As a security analyst, your work might involve digital forensics. Digital forensics is the process of collecting and analyzing data to determine what has happened after an attack. KALI LINUX™ has a large number of tools that can be used for this:
- **tcpdump**: A command-line packet analyzer used to capture network traffic.
- **Wireshark**: A graphical user interface that can be used to analyze live and captured network traffic.
- **Autopsy**: A forensic tool used to analyze hard drives and smartphones. 📱
