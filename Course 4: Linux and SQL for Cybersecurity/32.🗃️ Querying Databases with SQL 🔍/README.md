# 🗃️ Querying Databases with SQL 🔍

## Introduction
As a security analyst, you'll need to be familiar with both databases and the tools used to access them. Now that we know the basics of databases, let's focus on an important tool used to work with them: SQL. We'll learn more about how analysts like yourself might utilize SQL. 🌟

## What is SQL? 🤔
SQL, pronounced "S-Q-L" or "sequel," stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database. SQL is essential for retrieving logs and performing data analytics as a security analyst.

### Defining a Query 📜
A query is a request for data from a database table or a combination of tables. Nearly all relational databases rely on some version of SQL to query data. The different versions of SQL have slight structural differences, like where to place quotation marks, but the core functionality remains consistent.

## Importance of SQL in Security 🔐
### Retrieving Logs 🗂️
Logs are records of events that occur within an organization's systems. As a security analyst, you might be tasked with reviewing logs for various reasons:
- Identifying improperly configured machines.
- Analyzing visitor activity on your website or web app for unusual patterns that may indicate malicious activity.

Security logs are often very large and hard to process manually. SQL can search through millions of data points to extract relevant rows of data using a single query that takes seconds to run. That's pretty useful, right?

### Basic Data Analytics 📈
SQL is also a very common language used for basic data analytics, another set of skills that will set you apart as a security analyst. You can use SQL to:
- Identify machines that haven't received the latest patch.
- Determine the best time to update a machine based on when it's least used.

## Hands-On with SQL 🛠️
Now that we know why SQL is important to us, we're going to start making basic queries to a sample database! This is definitely exciting, so let's dive in and explore the power of SQL together. 🚀
