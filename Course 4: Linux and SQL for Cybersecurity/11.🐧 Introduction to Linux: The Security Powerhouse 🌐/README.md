# 🐧 Introduction to Linux: The Security Powerhouse 🌐

## Exploring Linux 🖥️
You might have seen or heard the name Linux in the past. But did you know Linux is the most-used operating system in security today? Let's start by taking a look at Linux and how it's used in security.

## The Birth of Linux 🛠️
Linux is an open-source operating system created in two parts. In the early 1990s, two different people were working separately on projects to improve computer engineering. 

### The Pioneers 🚀
- **Linus Torvalds**: At the time, the UNIX operating system was already in use. Linus wanted to improve it and make it open source and accessible to anyone. His revolutionary introduction of the Linux kernel played a key role.
- **Richard Stallman**: Around the same time, Richard started working on GNU, another operating system based on UNIX. Stallman shared Torvalds' goal of creating software that was free and open to anyone. Together, their innovations made what is commonly referred to as Linux. 

## What Makes Linux Unique? 🌟
### Open Source Philosophy 🔓
Linux is open source, meaning anyone can access the operating system and its source code. Linux and many of its programs are licensed under the GNU Public License, allowing you to use, share, and modify them freely.

### Community Collaboration 🤝
Thanks to Linux's open-source philosophy and strong feature set, an entire community of developers has adopted this operating system. These developers collaborate on projects and advance computing together.

### Versatility in Security 🛡️
As a security analyst, you'll find Linux used in various organizations and many security programs.

### Diverse Distributions 🌐
Another unique feature of Linux is the different distributions or varieties that have been developed. There are over 600 distributions of Linux, thanks to the large community contribution. Each distribution is created to fit the needs of its users.

## Linux in Entry-Level Security Positions 🔍
### Everyday Tools and Programs 🛠️
As a security analyst, you'll use many tools and programs in your work. You might examine different types of logs to identify system events. For example, you might look at an error log when investigating an issue.

### Access and Authorization Management 🔑
Another place you'll use Linux is to verify access and authorization in an identity and access management system. Managing access is key to ensuring a secure system.

### Specific Distributions for Tasks ⚙️
You might find yourself working with specific distributions designed for particular tasks. For example, you might use a distribution with digital forensic tools to investigate an event alert or a distribution for pen testing in offensive security to look for vulnerabilities in the system.
