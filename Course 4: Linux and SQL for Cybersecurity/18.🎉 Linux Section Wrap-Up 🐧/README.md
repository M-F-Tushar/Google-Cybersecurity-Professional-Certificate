We've made it to the end of this section. Great work! Let's recap what you've just completed. 📚

### What You Learned 📖

1. **Linux Operating System**: We examined the architecture of Linux, understanding its structure and components. 🛠️
2. **Linux Distributions**: We explored different distributions widely used in security, including KALI LINUX™, Ubuntu, Parrot, Red Hat, and CentOS. 🌐
3. **The Shell**: You were introduced to the shell, learning about its role as an interpreter between the user and the operating system. 💻

## Moving Forward 🚀

Congratulations! You're doing great, and we have more useful topics to come. In the next part of the program, you'll learn specific commands to use within the shell while working as a security analyst. Let's continue on. 💪
