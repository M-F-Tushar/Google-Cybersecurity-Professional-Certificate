# 🌍 Adedayo's Journey into Cybersecurity at Google 🌟

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Adedayo, a Security Engineer at Google. Many people think you need a degree in computer science to get into cybersecurity, but that's not true. Let's dive into my journey and how SQL has been essential in my role. 🚀

## My Journey 🛤️
I started learning IT in Lagos, Nigeria, where I was born and raised. Now, I'm working in Silicon Valley for Google. It's amazing and a dream come true. Taking this certificate is your first step towards switching your career to cybersecurity. Kudos to you! 🌟

## The Importance of SQL 🛠️
SQL is a vital skill for any cybersecurity professional. It allows you to make data-driven decisions and communicate effectively with your team and stakeholders. Saying "we need to do this" is one thing, but saying "we need to do this and here's the data to back it up" is another. 📊

## Learning SQL 📚
I learned SQL through coursework in school, but I forgot most of it after graduation. I took online courses, like the one you're taking now, to learn SQL fundamentals and practical use. My first practical experience with SQL was at Google. Practice makes perfect—set aside a few hours a week to practice writing SQL statements. 💡

## Applying SQL in Cybersecurity 🔐
Having SQL skills is very applicable to your first job in cybersecurity. You can use SQL to make data-driven decisions and feel fulfilled knowing your work is for the betterment of Google users and employees. 🌐

## Conclusion 🌟
I feel very energized working in cybersecurity, solving complex problems, and collaborating with great teammates. Knowing that my work helps protect Google users and employees is incredibly rewarding. Keep learning and practicing SQL—it's a valuable skill in your cybersecurity journey! 😊
