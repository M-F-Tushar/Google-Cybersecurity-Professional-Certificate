# 📚 Introduction to the Eight CISSP Security Domains 🌐

As the tactics of threat actors evolve, so do the roles of security professionals. Having a solid understanding of core security concepts supports growth in this field. One way to better understand these core concepts is by organizing them into categories, called security domains. 🌟

CISSP defines eight domains to organize the work of security professionals. It's important to understand that these domains are related and that gaps in one domain can negatively impact an entire organization. Understanding these domains can also help you better grasp your career goals and role within an organization. 🌐

**In this note, we'll discuss the first four domains:**
1. **Security and Risk Management** 🔒
2. **Asset Security** 🗂️
3. **Security Architecture and Engineering** 🛠️
4. **Communication and Network Security** 📡

## 1. Security and Risk Management 🔒
- Focuses on defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law. 📋
- Example: Security analysts may need to update company policies related to private health information if a change is made to a federal compliance regulation, such as HIPAA. 🏥

## 2. Asset Security 🗂️
- Focuses on securing digital and physical assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. 🗄️
- Example: Security analysts may be tasked with making sure that old equipment is properly disposed of and destroyed, including any confidential information. 🗑️

## 3. Security Architecture and Engineering 🛠️
- Focuses on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. 🔧
- Example: Security analysts may need to configure a firewall, a device used to monitor and filter network traffic, helping prevent attacks that could affect productivity. 🔥

## 4. Communication and Network Security 📡
- Focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications. 📶
- Example: Security analysts may need to create a network policy to prevent and mitigate exposure from unsecured wireless hotspots. 🚫

## Conclusion
Maintaining an organization's security is a team effort with many moving parts. As an entry-level analyst, continue to develop your skills by learning how to mitigate risks and keep people and data safe. You don't need to be an expert in all domains, but having a basic understanding will aid you in your journey as a security professional. 🚀
