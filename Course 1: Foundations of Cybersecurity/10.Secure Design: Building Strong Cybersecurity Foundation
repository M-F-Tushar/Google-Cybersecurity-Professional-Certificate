**Secure Design: Building Strong Cybersecurity Foundations 🔧**

### **Introduction to Secure Design 🛡️**
Welcome back! Now that we've explored **security frameworks and controls**, let’s dive into how organizations use specific models to **minimize risks and protect users**.

### **The CIA Triad: The Foundation of Security 🔒**
A key model in cybersecurity is the **CIA Triad**, which helps organizations assess risks when designing security systems. CIA stands for:
- **Confidentiality** 🔐 – Ensuring only authorized users can access sensitive information.
- **Integrity** ⚖️ – Protecting data from unauthorized modifications or corruption.
- **Availability** 📁 – Ensuring systems remain accessible when needed.

### **Why Secure Design Matters 🌐**
Organizations must build security into their systems from the **ground up** to prevent vulnerabilities. Secure design:
🔄 Reduces the risk of **data breaches**.
🏢 Ensures compliance with **security policies & regulations**.
🛡️ Strengthens protection against **cyberattacks**.

### **Final Thoughts: Think Security First! ✨**
By following the **CIA Triad and secure design principles**, organizations create systems that are **resilient and trustworthy**. Cybersecurity isn’t an afterthought—it’s **a core part of system development**!
