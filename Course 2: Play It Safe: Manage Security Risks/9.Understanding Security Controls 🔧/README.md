**Understanding Security Controls 🔧**

### **What Are Security Controls? 🌐**
While **frameworks create security plans**, **controls are specific safeguards** used to **reduce security risks**. Without proper controls, organizations can face **financial loss and reputational damage** due to risks like:
- **Unauthorized access** (e.g., fake employee accounts).
- **Data breaches** (e.g., leaked sensitive information).
- **Physical security threats** (e.g., trespassing).

### **Three Common Types of Security Controls 🔒**

1. **Encryption 🔐**
   - Converts readable data (**plaintext**) into unreadable **ciphertext**.
   - Ensures **confidentiality** of sensitive data like account details and Social Security numbers.
   - Decryption restores data back to its original form when needed.

2. **Authentication 🔓**
   - Verifies a user’s identity before granting access.
   - Basic authentication: **Username & password**.
   - Advanced authentication: **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** (e.g., security code, fingerprint, facial recognition).

3. **Authorization 💾**
   - Determines **what resources a user can access**.
   - Example: A federal security analyst may have access to **classified government data**, while a regular employee does not.

### **Social Engineering Alert: Vishing ⚡**
📞 **Vishing** (voice phishing) is when attackers use **voice communication** to steal sensitive information.
- Example: Impersonating a person’s voice to gain unauthorized access.
- Security controls like **MFA and biometrics** help prevent such attacks.

### **Final Thoughts: Security Controls Keep Systems Safe! ✨**
Security controls are a key part of the **CIA Triad** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Up next, we’ll explore how this model helps security teams **strengthen their defenses**!
